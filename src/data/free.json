      "description": "Barton Springs is a classic Austin hot spot, especially during the hot summer months. The water here is a constant 72 degrees. The natural spring is home to an endangered species of blind salamander. While tickets are usually on sale for $5, if you show up from 5-8AM / 5-9AM depending on the day or 8-10PM you can get in for free. Life guards are off duty during these times. Just remember to check the hours online, because they change pretty frequently. However, another free option is taking a trail to the left of the park entrance where people swim for free in the run off. While the park itself doesn’t allow dogs or alcohol, free Barton is an extremely lively and dog friendly place.",
